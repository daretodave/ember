## Pending

### [x] [4.2] test gap — auth middleware has no unit tests

- category: tests
- impact: 6
- ease: 7
- observation: `src/middleware.ts` had no unit tests despite being the sole auth guard for all protected routes (`/today`, `/log`, `/settings`). It also redirects authenticated users away from `/signin`.
- evidence: `find src -name "*.test.*" | xargs grep -l "middleware"` returned no results.
- suggested fix: add `src/__tests__/middleware.test.ts` covering unauthenticated redirects, authenticated pass-through, and /signin-to-/today redirect.
- issue: #11
- resolution: added 12 tests in `src/__tests__/middleware.test.ts` using `@vitest-environment node`. Shipped at f5990c2.

### [x] [4.2] content gap — only 20 prompts vs spec target of ~100; rotation repeats every 20 days

- category: content-gaps
- impact: 7
- ease: 6
- observation: `content/prompts.json` contains 20 entries. The deterministic rotation in `src/lib/prompts.ts` cycles `daysSinceEpoch % prompts.length`, so any user practicing daily sees the same prompt every 20 days. Phase 5 brief specified "a seed list of ~100 prompts."
- evidence: `cat content/prompts.json | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(len(json.load(sys.stdin)))"` → 20
- suggested fix: expand content/prompts.json to ~100 entries in the established voice. Delegate to prompt-curator sub-agent; no schema or code changes required.
- next: spawn prompt-curator sub-agent to write ~80 additional prompts + tasks in the established voice
- issue: #10
- resolution: expanded content/prompts.json from 20 to 101 entries via prompt-curator sub-agent. Shipped at a6d0d49.

### [user-issue #6] [HIGH] [needs-user-call] entries table missing from Supabase — migrations not applied

- category: external-issue
- impact: 9
- ease: 6
- issue: #6
- investigated: 2026-05-16 — confirmed all 4 migrations in supabase/migrations/ were never applied to the connected project. Direct DB is IPv6-only (unreachable from CI runner); Management API requires a PAT that is not provisioned.
- shipped: scripts/migrate.mjs + pnpm db:migrate (Path B); full SQL posted to issue #6 comment (Path A — paste into Supabase SQL Editor, no tools needed).
- next: user must apply migrations via one of the two paths in issue #6. Once applied, add SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN to GitHub Actions secrets so the cloud loop can push future migrations automatically.

## Done

### [x] [6.3] stale useCallback closure in SettingsForm silently ignores personalizedVal on save

- category: bug
- impact: 7
- ease: 9
- resolution: added `personalizedVal` to the `useCallback` dependency array. Shipped at 0419eb3.
- issue: #9

### [x] [5.4] robots.txt and sitemap.xml absent — site is not crawlable

- category: seo
- impact: 6
- ease: 9
- issue: #7
- resolution: added `src/app/robots.ts` and `src/app/sitemap.ts` using Next.js 15 App Router conventions. Shipped at 8e399c7.

### [x] [4.9] OG / social metadata absent on all pages

- category: seo
- impact: 7
- ease: 7
- resolution: added openGraph (type, siteName, title, description, url) and twitter card (summary) to root layout metadata. Text cards now surface on every social/messaging platform. No OG image for v1. Shipped at 2907586.

### [x] [4.0] auth/callback route has no unit test

- category: tests
- impact: 5
- ease: 8
- issue: #8
- resolution: added `src/app/auth/callback/__tests__/route.test.ts` with 3 tests covering all three branches. Shipped at bef2c0e.

### [user-issue #5] [HIGH] log in bug — magic-link callback redirects to localhost

- category: external-issue
- impact: 9
- ease: 7
- resolution: added `VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL` as fallback in `src/app/api/auth/signin/route.ts` so the route no longer falls back to `http://localhost:3000` when `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is absent. Added two targeted tests covering the env-var fallback chain. Note: the Supabase Dashboard "Site URL" at Authentication → URL Configuration should also be set to the production Vercel URL — that is a user action in the Supabase console.
